				<head>Digital Hybridity and the Question of Aesthetic Opposition</head>
				<byline><docAuthor><persName key="Drucker, Johanna, 1952-...." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/71503942" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/naJ1mS9rVUm">Johanna Drucker</persName></docAuthor> University of Virginia</byline>
				<p>Is there a fanatical inevitably in the capacity of electronic media to absorb all
					forms of human expression and experience into data formats? In his discussions
					of aesthetics and ideology, <persName key="Adorno, Theodor W., 1903-1969." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/95247377" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/KHBjmkTuXJK">Theodor Adorno</persName> continually reiterated the caveat
					that when positivist logic invades culture to an extreme then representation
					appears to present a "unitary" truth in a totalizing model of thought which
					leaves little room for critical action or agency.(1) Pulling this unity apart is
					essential to critical rationality (as distinct from instrumental rationality) in
					its struggle to maintain a gap between data and idea, form and experience, the
					absolute and the lived. In the hybrid condition of the digital the separation
					necessary to sustain the distinction between the instrumental and the critical
					appears to be precluded. The "absolute" identity of the mathematical underpinnings of all digital
					activity seems to collapse concept and materiality into one and the same as an
					encoded file. As the popular idea of technological "truth" continues to function
					as an instrumental force in the in- creasing rationalization of culture, artwork
					which renders such "truths" assimilable, performing in what <persName key="Adorno, Theodor W., 1903-1969." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/95247377" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/NWp1Sl4PjOD">Adorno</persName> would term a
					reconciliatory manner. Such work seems profoundly insidious—unless it can be
					qualified within a critique of its assumptions, claims, and premises.</p>
				<p>Late-twentieth-century technical innovation pushes the boundaries of once
					discrete areas of cultural activity, transforming an ever increasing number of
					arenas into colonized domains within the managed bureaucracy of data processing.
					As it does so, the hard and fast opposition between two traditions which had
					been markedly distinct in the visual arts are increasingly difficult to
					sustain—in part because they each depended upon identification with
					contradictory concepts of the role of reason. The first is the antilyrical,
					antisubjective, rational tradition of art which aspires to the condition of
					science. The second is a humanistic, lyrical, subjective romanticism which
					opposed emotional, natural, and/or chaotic forces to those of technologically
					driven progress. Hybridity of machine/ organic entities is a current condition.
					The old oppositions no longer hold—the machine is the flesh, the body is
					technical, nature is culture. The cyborg is the sign and actualization of the
					current lived condition of humanity—and more and more it is clear that as the
					arts have helped familiarize and legitimate many of these once unthinkable ideas
					the capacity for aesthetics to regulate boundaries between rational and
					irrational regimes of technology is limited.</p>
				<p> There are many areas of contemporary art activity in which these themes could be
					examined: the imagery of mutation, sculpture and installation work which merges
					new technology with conventional media, work which extends the human body
					through technological prostheses or otherwise toys with machine aesthetics in
					new, synthetic ways.(2) All are interesting manifestations of a profound
					transformation. But the implications of this change can be brought into focus
					through a more narrow, and perhaps more fundamental avenue: an inquiry into the
					identity of digital technology. Digitalization seems to offer the possible
					fulfillment of Gottfried Leibniz's dream of a universe fully available to
					logical analysis and description—in short, his vision of mathesis as a complete
					logic that maps in a one-to-one correlation between thought and representation.</p>
					<p>As art's dialogue with technology extends into the digital arena, the questions
					that arise can be posed in philosophical terms which frame their political
					implications. Here these questions will be pose in terms of the work of <persName key="Adorno, Theodor W., 1903-1969." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/95247377" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/0WQZqaK9TNe">Adorno</persName>'s
					conception of aesthetics as potentially resistant (no longer liberatory, given
					his profound pessimism) At midcentury, <persName key="Adorno, Theodor W., 1903-1969." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/95247377" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/2qRlTLE8pUQ">Adorno</persName> struggle to articulate the
					capacity of aesthetics to resist the forces and tropes of instrumental reason
					informing an increasingly commodified consumer society. All cultural production
					(and reception) had come to mirror the processes of capitalism, with their
					mind-dulling repetitions and formulas, while the capacity of what passed for
					reason to perform with destructive force had been made all too vividly clear
					within the events of the Second World War. Aesthetics could only effectively
					resist such processes through a refused of utility and systemality. <persName key="Adorno, Theodor W., 1903-1969." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/95247377" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/Ca3a66QmSX6">Adorno</persName>
					placed considerable weight on formal strategies of artistic production as a
					means to achieve this goal. These can be identified by the terms
						<emph>determinate irreconcilability</emph>, <emph>dissonance</emph>, and
						<emph>nonidentity</emph> within a work of art.(3) Are these concepts
					sustainable within the context of the digital production of works of art? Or
					does the qualified absence of materiality of the digital environment
					fundamentally alter the way an artwork's identity and self-identity can be
					conceived within the dialectic of subject/object relations which <persName key="Adorno, Theodor W., 1903-1969." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/95247377" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/IVVfDqsCuY9">Adorno</persName> derived
					from <persName key="Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich, 1770-1831." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/89774942" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/T0tiI6fHvuW">Hegel</persName>'s aesthetics?</p>
				<p>A secondary aspect of this discussion is the relation of twentieth-century art to
					positivistic logic and its embodiment of an Enlightenment ideal of reason. logic
					only rarely serves as the thematic subject of a work of art, but positivist
					assumptions about systemality under- lie the motivation of many
					twentieth-century artists' practices. Art using digital technology depends on
					mathematical logic and its peculiar hybrid sibling, programming language. Within
					digital tech&gt;nology an image or artwork comes to be perceived as "information
					and therefore as an essential, absolute, quantifiable identity. The notion that
					an image can be "reduced to or is "equivalent to" a data file, an algorithm, a
					program, or any mathematical, quantifiable identity are all ideas which give
					rise to a notion of digital identity as absolute and certain.</p>

					antidote and means of resistance to the domination by all sections of society

					(always read as an extension of rationalized modes of production into the

					perceptions of representation are themselves subjected to such a positivist
					logic. This occurs, <persName key="Horkheimer, Max, 1895-1973." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/14771315" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/yaHtRo7ML4D">Horkheimer</persName> and <persName key="Adorno, Theodor W., 1903-1969." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/95247377" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/LiouEb2abmQ">Adorno</persName> suggest, in the approach to
					language/image in which a literalist, positivist interpretation forces
					representation into a collusion/elision with the "real" so that one takes the
					"word for the thing"—the "image for the real"—the "representation for the
					referent" in every instance.(4) This collapse of the discrete structures of
					representation into a perceived unity makes it virtually (in the technical sense
					of the word) impossible to insert any critical distance into an understanding of
					representation and its social function. The distance between Leibniz and <persName key="Adorno, Theodor W., 1903-1969." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/95247377" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/UIErd1vzknw">Adorno</persName>
					coincides with the temporal span which encompasses cultural modernity. What was
					for Leibniz the glimpsed possibility of total, all-encompassing, descriptive and
					analytic reason has become for <persName key="Adorno, Theodor W., 1903-1969." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/95247377" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/8xw6frDidw4">Adorno</persName> (and <persName key="Horkheimer, Max, 1895-1973." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/14771315" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/H0W2wjFxFra">Horkheimer</persName> and others) the
					nightmarish image of totalizing control effected by instrumental
					rationality.</p>
				<p>Artistic engagement with modernity as a phenomena which rapidly transformed
					every area of cultural production, communication, and administration attached a
					wide range of valences to rationality and technology. A keen awareness of the
					effects of the radical changes wrought on lived experience produced celebratory
					as well as critical responses. The positive utopianism of avant-gardes was
					premised on the belief that progress promised liberation of humanity from
					oppressive labor and its social constants, while the nihilis- tic negation of
					technorationality attacked these premises and the entire tradition of positivist
					thought with its origins in the Enlightenment. There was also a tension between
					the idea that the escape from reason was the means to salvation for the human
					spirit and a contradictory position that invocked rationality as an antidote to
					injustice and social onequities in the name of an Enlightenment project. Many
					reforminst and counterculture movements of the late nineteenth century give
					evidence of increased momentum for a critical opposition to an unchecked and
					unquestioned concept of "progress" as the automatic gloss on any feature of
					modern technology or its effects.</p>
				<p>By the early twentieth century, aesthetic engagement with the technological
					manifestations of rationality (and later the irrational manifestions of supposed
					reason) map across a considerable range of more sharply defined positions. These
					include the enthusiastic production of a machine aesthetic—Robert Delaunay's
					renowned paintings of the Eiffel Tower, Fernand Léger's machine motifs, and
					futurist works (and rhetoric) in praise of motor cars, trains, and industrially
					produced objects. A clear privilege was assigned to the inorganic and technical
					over and against the holistic, humanistic, or organic. The ironic counterpart in
					the work of <rs key="Dada" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6034" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/Cfsr5GPKjdn">Dada</rs> poets and painters, conspicuously nuanced in the oeuvre of
					<persName key="Duchamp, Marcel, 1887-1968" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/36917441" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/kpu8qIbpjd8">Marcel Duchamp</persName>, is an understandable contemporary counterpoint response. The
					embrace of chance operations and resolutely asystematic negations of the very
					premises of rationality eschewed any nostalgic return to the lyrical, personal,
					or artisanal which had been held out as antidotes to industrialization and
					modernity in earlier decades in the Arts and Crafts movement, in symbolist
					aesthetics, or among the Pre-Raphaelites.</p>
				<p>The influence of reason in the sphere of cultural practice can also be seen in
					the colonization of humanistic "soft" disciples by a "scientificizing" attitude.
					The idea of the social <emph>sciences</emph> of linguistics, anthropology,
					society, and politics gains currency in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
					centuries. The aspirations of the usual arts to identify their own systematic
					tenets and become practiced with guaranteeable, repeatable, and predictable
					"results" are part of this general cultural pattern. All of this would be merely
					a historical description of a past cultural moment were it not for the fact that
					the continuum which streetches from this scientificizing impulse continues into
					the present, providing assumptions on which the legitimacy of the digital is
					premised. And one crucial factor in forging the connection which interweave the
					sciences and humanities is the historical emergence of logic (first in George
					Boole's "algebra", which comes to serve as the basis of programming languages.
					Logic comes to dominante the philosophical inquiry into language in the work of
					anglo-american analytic philosophers <persName key="Russell, Bertrand, 1872-1970." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/36924137" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/I4utIZRaelr">Bertrand Russell</persName> and Alfred North
					Whitehead, and the group around Rudolf Carnap. On the basis of this link the
					concept of <emph>mathesis</emph>—the logical calculus of thought—revives its
					potency within the digital arts—since all digital and electric operations are
					based on a mathematical processing (if not an algorithmic production) of visual
					images and works of art. With the realization that it is such mathematical logic, and not a machine
					aesthetic, which is the basis of digital work's relation to the technological as
					a concept and as a practice, it is possible to begin to place this link in the
					context of the larger discussion of those overt connections between art and
					machines, aesthetics and technology, in the twentieth century. The distinction
					between a machine aesthetic and a more general aestheticizing of technological
					processes within the celebration of logic and systemality can be elicited from
					the different premises exemplified by Lazar El Lissitzky, <persName key="Léger, Fernand, 1881-1955." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/34459370" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/RboYofcM9hF">Fernand Léger</persName>, and
					<persName key="Kandinsky, Wassily, 1866-1944" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/22143802" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/FJsr3AlqTsK">Wassily Kandinsky</persName>.</p>
				<p>In a 1923 work titled <title>The New Man</title>, El Lissitzky depicts a single
					figure, sufficiently anthropomorphic to clearly fulfil the expectations of its
					title, but composed of forms constructed entirely with mechanical drawing
					instruments. A single circular arc describes the curve of the torso from
					shoulders through hips. The limbs are stretched outward in the directions of the
					four axes of an axonometric diagram, their volume thinly designated by minimally
					described shapes. A hand is described by a thin arc segment of a dark circle,
					another is merely the terminus of several aligned rectangular strips, the feet
					created out of short board resambling the base of a lampstand crudely
					constructed from carpentry remains for purposes of utility. The head, rising
					above the squared-off geometric of the should ders, is made of two partial
					circles, overlapped along a central gap between them in which features of a
					cut-out profile are sharply suggested. There is no simulacral imitation of a
					machine in this work. Unlike the ironic mechanomorphs produced by Francis
					Picabia in the same period, with their satiric play on the erotics of machine
					aesethetics, Lissiztsky's image makes a straightforward claim, placing the
					constructed aesthetic forward as an unequivocally positive vision.</p>
				<p>But Lisstizky's image only makes use of mechanical instruments in its
					construction—it is not itself an image of a machine. The integration of elements
					in the figure do not articulate as working parts of a guard, motored, or
					functional apparatus. The image is not of a man-as-machine. Nor is it a
					simplistic mapping of the features of a machine form onto the figure of a man.
					The work takes its point of aesthetic departure from a more fundamental
					interrogation of organic and machine principles as the basis of design. The
					merging of the two takes the form of a hybrid aesthetic in which the assumption
					of a shared system underlies both modes of production. <title>The New
						Man</title> is not a machine, but a systematic production. There is no
					identifying detail, no sense of a portrait, no Sense of an identity within the
					image—it is generic, prototypical, and emblematic. It reads as a sign and
					program, a condensed image signifying a prescriptive rather than descriptive
					image of a "new man." Like a template or pattern, the geometric forms suggest
					the possibility of manufacture and production, not depiction, in their spare
					simplicity.</p> 
				<p>By contrast the work of Ferdinand Léger, <title>Ballet
						mécanique</title>, places exaggerated emphasis on reconceiving the human
					body in terms of a single metaphor of machine imagery. Léger, whose early cubist
					work of the decide before World War I was largely engaged with the analysis of
					forms in a reductive geometric, had become infatuated with machines during his
					war experiences. "I was dazzled by the breech of a seventy-five millimeter gun
					which was standing uncovered in the sunlight: the magic of light on white
					metal."(5) Apocryphal though this statement may be, it exemplifies the all too
					familiar and now much discussed relation between the rationalist aesthetic of
					certain early avant-garde movements and the militaristic emergence of fascism
					with its tropes of efficiency. The negative characterization of instrumental
					rationality articulated by <persName key="Adorno, Theodor W., 1903-1969." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/95247377" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/BqJdmGxWRf9">Adorno</persName> attaches with an understandable vehement to
					the aestheticization process which enables such values.</p>
				<p>The superficiality of Léger's grasp of machinery is evident in the rapid
					reproduction of hard-edged, shine, machined forms as the basic building blocks
					(and surface and treatments) of his work. Even the phrase "machine aesthetic"
					seems from the outset to be stigmatized by a superficiality and a sense that it
					is a mere act of appropriation which combines the two in a causal fashion parade
					of formal novelties decked out for consumption. The "machine aesthetic" can be
					read as a link between the industrial machinery of overproduction and the need
					to provide consumption through tempting the appetite of the consumer. Such
					aestheticization is also a response to the early twentieth-century ennui, a
					neurasthenic and general cultural malaise in negative response to increased
					industrialization iconically signed in Charlie Chaplin's <title>Modern
						Times</title>.(6) Such malaise may not have resulted in a full-blown
					critically articulated opposition, though sporadic and organized resistances
					occur throughout the industrialization of nations practically from the moment of
					the incetition of industrial methods of manufacture.</p> 
				<p>Lissitzky's work shares an
					embrace of the rational with that of Léger, but it exemplifies a set of ordering
					principles rather than merely celebrating industrial production and machinery in
					its many manifestations. Interest in his concept of systemality is a vision of
					individual interrogation into a social whole as a positive possibility and the
					basis of functional collectivity. Thus the conceal parameters of Lissitzky's
					approach to systematic thought are not burdened by the negative critical
					characterization which <persName key="Adorno, Theodor W., 1903-1969." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/95247377" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/2e0vxcqiyvO">Adorno</persName> will attach to them in the later 1920s and then
					from that point outward. But the systematic character of Lissitzky's aesthetic
					is still at a remove from the overarching concept governing the longer
					historical argu- ment—namely the argument about the relation between
						<emph>mathesis</emph> and aesthetics. Lissitzky's distinctive approach to
					design is clearly consistent with a more general agenda of constructivism and,
					in its grounded relation to instrumental application within a social realm of
					real production—the basis on which such an aesthetic developed, whatever its
					roots within more esoterically inclined abstractions — has to be factored into
					any interpretation of its forms.(7) This is useful since this historical
					evidence justifies the critical link between aesthetic and social/cultural
					implications of systemality, but it also distances Lissitzky somewhat from
					Kandinsky, whose work is a useful third term to introduce into the discussion of
					rationalized aesthetics in the early twentieth century.</p>
				<p>Although Kandinsky loads his earlier searches for a systematic "language" of
					visual symbols to a spiritual agenda redolent with synaestic dimensions, his
					work in the 1920s establishes certain paradigmatic texts and approaches. <title>Point and Line to Plane</title>, published in 1926, was a
					crucial articulation of an abstract vocabulary of forms and their relations. The
					project of this work is to establish terms of certainty, of predictable and
					guaranteeable formal relations, among visual elements. In short, the promise
					that such a possibility can be envisioned is itself a product of the more
					general early twentieth century embrace of a rationalism, and the execution is
					possible because the general understanding of how such a project could be
					carried out has natured. Kandinsky's work, naive as it may appear in retrospect,
					established a precedent which had a developed following in the realm of graphic
					design. few artists' handbooks of the <title>Point and Line</title> variety have
					the credibility of Kandinsky's early endeavour, though the writings of Gyorgi
					Kepes, Johannes Itten, Josef Albers, and others are all continuations of this
					rational approach to usual experience and representation. Many lesser titles in
					this vein deteriorated into copy books of simplistic formal solutions or how-to
					pamphlets without critical or theoretical aspirations. But in the realm of
					graphic design the lineage is considerable and the idea of graphic systems
					became a useful instrument in the increasing corporatization of design functions
					as well as in the later field of information design. The <title>Catalogue Design
						Progress</title> (1950), Ladislav Sutnar's elaborate catalogue of template
					for designing legible hierarchies and sequences of display, is an outstanding
					example of a genre which in- cludes the full range of work from trade handbooks
					to sophisticated and elegant models.(8)</p>
				<p>Kandinsky's work provides another key element—the suggestion of a Pythagorean
					faith in alignment of values of color into form into mathematical number.
					Kandinsky's faith in the absolute, in "value as an essence feature of form,
					combines the mystical and mathematical without apparent conflict. The idea of
					synaesthesia is closer to the idea of the mutability of the digital file than
					any idea of aesetheties wedded to materially apparent form would be—since there
					is an implication that the numerical value of a color, a form, or a musical note
					besides in an essence outside its material. In digital storage, a file has no
					necessary relation between the form in which it was input (as a text, a sound,
					an image) and the form of its output. The contrast among the three artists' work
					allows distinctions to be made clear between image and representation at a
					conceptual level. The Léger, with its machine motifs, is finally an <emph>image
						of</emph>, or a <emph>representation of</emph>, superficial and stylistic,
					whose referent is outside itself no matter how much its own surface and their
					treatments replicate the modes and manners of industrial production. It poses no
					critique since its aestheticization serves to reconcile such production with the
					culture as "natural" --as the leitmotif of the times. Lissitzky's <title>The New
						Man</title> enacts its aesthetic premises within the image, its premises,
					and its production. Still celebratory, its own interrogation is complete. The
					subjugation of natural material of human life and form into the modes of
					rational production has hybridized the two domains indissolubly. Machinic and
					systematic conception are one with the an-thropomorphic; criticality has no
					space in which to enter; the aesthetic naturalizes the activity as an effect.
					Kandinsky's systematic, mystical equivalences abstract value from form while
					asserting the absolute capacity of form to embody this value in an immutable and
					uninflected presencing of truth. Value is form as truth in essence in this
					equation with its many interchangeable terms. Within the consideration of
						<emph>mathesis</emph> Léger's work falls away as mere skin, a surface
					effect, while Lissitzky's work exemplifies a set of structuring principles, and
					Kandinsky's a revelation mystical faith in number as essence. Kandinsky never
					suggests a mathematical calculus of form or composition—he merely implies it at
					every turn within the <title>Improvisations</title> he painted and their
					musical/mathematical analogies. All three embrace, consciously or not, a
					positivistic and scientificized attitude toward art production and each
					participates in the early twentieth-century engagement with systemality in the
					visual arts. But in the early twentieth century it is clearly not machine
					aesthetics which is the most complete expression of rationalism; rather it is
					the fundamental attempt at grounding art in a basis which approaches science,
					mimicking its capacity for logical certainties, which are the goal of this
					positivist imperative.</p>
				<p>Midcentury developments in the dialogue of positivism and art are as varied as
					those of the earlier decades and are tempered considerably by the post-world War
					II reflections on the destructive character of technorationality. Information
					science, which flourished within the administrative and military industries of
					the war years, expended out of the instructed domain of esoteric application
					extending the ever broadening reach which would, ultimately, push it toward its
					late twentieth-century penetration of every aspect of contemporary culture. The
					rational surface of modernist grids, replayed in the minimalist canvas and
					structures of system-generated art, give ample evidence of the persistence and
					aesthetic po- tency of this aesthetic. Sol Lewitt's famous dictum, "an idea is a
					machine that makes art," sutures the machinic and rational within his
					aesthetic—no matter how qualified each of these terms must be in actually
					assessing his projects.</p>
				<p>Computers began to find their way into art projects in the 1950s and 1960s,
					usually in elaborately conceived works whose conceptual parameters required a
					considerable amount of input for a relatively piddling material output. The
					burden of production was such that this work has a high efficient of
					conceptualization in proportion to the quality of final product. But such work
					established the basic paradigm distinguishing input from output, idea
					(algorithm, program) and material (printout, template, form) in a highly
					mediated manner—so that the "stuff" of a piece is data to be manipulated through
					process. fundamental to conceptual art as well as computer-generated work, this
					paradigm signals a radical break within the aesthetic underpinning of the fine
					arts since it renders overt the terms on which idea and material are
					distinguished—or cease to be distinguishable, depending on the extent to which
					the very identity of a work of digital art is posited within its digital
					file.</p>
				<p>There are many works within conceptual art narrowly defined (and within the
					reconceptualization of art broadly understood) which take the paradigmatic
					premises of this distinction between idea-as program and
					form-as-mere-incident-of-output as their basis from the 1960s outward. There is
					a corollary to be drawn between the classical sense of "essence" and "accident"
					here—in which the digital file has an immutable identity and the individual
					outputs it can be used to generate are each mere and unique but ever so slightly
					debased and individualed instances of that original. The question is whether the
					"essence" of the digital work is in fact its file, encoded and encrypted and
					clearly mathematical, or whether the digital work resides in a fulfilled
					expression of that file into a material form depends on the conceptual
					parameters of the piece.</p>
				<p>Here it seems useful to come back to a framework provided by <persName key="Adorno, Theodor W., 1903-1969." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/95247377" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/rXOh44FLEpT">Adorno</persName> in the
					following phrase: "The Same, which the artworks mean as their what, becomes
					through how they mean it, an Other."(9) <persName key="Adorno, Theodor W., 1903-1969." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/95247377" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/HKNnDER47Vl">Adorno</persName>'s aesthetic agenda depends on a
					separation between subject and object, on a persistent and irremediable
					difference at all levels of artistic production, which allows criticality to
					function. This "difference" takes the form of keeping idea separate from
					material— the "same" which is idea or content or thematic problem is made into
					an "other" through the extrusion into and embodiment in a materiality. The
					inability of these two to be identical can be maximized in works which promote a
					dissonant, nonunified, nonunifiable condition in their formal realization. Such
					work, by its own form and by its discuptive place in the cultural landscape of
					otherwise too-easily consumable objects, serves to keep the critical function
					alive. Dissonance without obscure, difficulty without reconciliation
					("determinate irreconcilability")—these functions keep the rational from
					dominating the material, keep reason from turning nature into its perfect image
					as some mere imitative form. Two examples of digital production provide
					contrasting problems in extending <persName key="Adorno, Theodor W., 1903-1969." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/95247377" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/dVCkhJoZqkH">Adorno</persName>'s promise into an analysis of the
					digital work: <title>Evolution of Form</title> (1990) of William
					Latham and the virus works of Joseph Nechvatel. Latham's work consists of
					algorithmically generated forms. They grow, mutate, and adapt within the
					parameters of an also mutating program. Its operation translates the problems of
					evolution into a reworked solution at the level of the program—the forms evolve
					according to the various solutions. The images are organic in appearance—tiny
					units of pale fleshy tissue emerging like some kind of mutant growth. They look
					more like trains, ovaries, or international organs than like self-sufficient
					organisms—clusters of cells organizing in order to perform a specialized rather
					than autonomous function. As forms, their identity is entirely linked to—is
					even, on some conceptual level isomorophic to—the films generated through the
					mathematical operation of the algorithms evolving and acting on each other. As
					an image of the process of form-giving, the work raises questions about whether
					the file is one with the image or distinct from it. The image cannot exist
					without the file—except in secondary format as photograph, printout, or other
					hard copy manifestation. But that level of existence is as secondary as a
					photographic reproduction of the <title>Mona Lisa</title>. As an original, the
						<title>Mona Lisa</title> is not linked to a file as its essence: it is its
					own essence and has its own ontological integrity—it <emph>is</emph> in every
					sense in its material manifestation. But are the "how" and the "what" of
					Latham's work distinct entities—or even distinct components within the original
					image-generating-file and file-linked-image? Is it even correct to name these as
					two different elements? Or are they merely two aspects of a single entity? And
					whether they are a single entity or not, they share a common promise—that the
					fundamental ontological condition of the image is as a mathematical entity. This
					entity is utterly consistent with the notion of a logical proposition, one which
					is able to be absorbed into the language of certainty and guaranteeability
					essential to logic. There is a lurking sense that the absolute truth reside in
					this file, in the digital code.</p>
				<p>Nechvatel's virus-affected image films offer an interesting contrast. Nechvatel
					creates image files—graphic, fixel-based images created through scanning,
					through the upload of visual data into a pixel tapestry. Such images are not
					algorithmic in their form or creation— they are stored as encoded descriptions
					of a surface or area of display. There is integrity to the relation between
					image and file, but only descriptively, not prescriptively. The graphic quality
					of such images means that they carry more data than can be described by
					mathematical formulas for their forms and shapes—merely carrying it as
					incidental information which has been inscribed into code storage (in the same
					way that a photographic surface carries much more information than can be
					described in a linguistic or algorithmic prescription for its forms). This
					stored file is then subjected to a virus which Nechvatel introduces
					electronically, getting it to "work" on the image file. Nothing happens on the
					display screen while this occurs. The virus works its way through the data
					files, damage them, reconfiguring the fixel tapastery. When the process is
					complete, the new tapestry is displayed. But is the relation of the new display
					to its data file the same as the original? Yes and no—yes because both are
					"mapped" as display, merely in a descriptive sense, but no because the second
					image / display also contains the visual signs of the algorithmic, programmed,
					vital damage. The image is not merely one with the generative file: it is one
					with an incidental stored file and a secondary process which has resulted in an
					altered file. The ontological condition of the altered file isn't the same as in
					the case of Latham—where the image and file evolve simultaneously. In
					Nechvatel's case the display is after the process, and is a record of it, and
					suggests a potential recuperation of that transformation process in the altered
					form of the display. The Nechvatel image does not have the same unity as the
					Latham—it may have the same relation of identity between final, extant file and
					display, but it is not unified in the originary sense which the Latham file is.
					All digital films have this unity of file and display, but within the record of
					their production processes there are varying potentialities for distinguishing
					critical distinction. The idea of Nechvatel's virus works on the material of the
					digital file—and in that gap the critical enters and produces a dissonant
					fracturing. Nechvatel's image contains a critical opposition to itself, as part
					of itself, a split identity in its apparent unity, This is because Nechvatel's
					graphic file preexists the mathematical operation—thus allowing the "stuff" of a
					material image to enter into a relation with the immaterial action of a
					mathematical operation. Nechvatel's is not a hermetic universe, singular and
					closed, in its relations of ontological essence and manifestation.</p>
				<p>The virtual is not the absolute—not some based condition of unity in which there
					is no concevable critical distance. But the virtual can enact a new condition of
					unity which precludes, by simulacral effect, by a confusion of image and the
					impossibility of difference within it, any substance difference between concept
					and matter, idea and form. If the absolute is the condition of giving up of the
					distinction, difference between subject and object, image and thing,
					representation and referent—then the virtual is rather a forced admission that
					there never was a difference except in theory. The virtual does not represent,
					and also <emph>is</emph> not, an achievement of unity after a struggle. 
				This seems to be the case with Latham's <title>Form</title>.</p> <p>The positivist
					underpinning of artistic scientificization gains considerable justification in
					the digital-where the "materiality" of art production is inscribed and contained
					entirely within the mathematical equivalentes of electronically stored films.
					The question is whether the digital image is completely self-identical,
					hopelessly constrained within the terms of a unity of idea and form at the level
					of trace inscription in binary code, or whether the gap which separates file
					from each and every instance of manifestation in material output (display on the
					screen, print, pattern, template) makes the separation of concept and execution
					greater than ever before. One can take the position that the file is the work in
					the most absolute ontological sense of its being the essence of the work at a
					level of descriptive code which replicates without variation outside of
					temporal/historical/subjective influences. Or one can take the opposite
					position, that the code is utterly ephemeral, only an effect of highly mutable,
					subject-to-fastion-whim and direction of the origoing industry changes, and that
					the relation between "idea" as code and "form" as object/material manifestation
					has never been more clearly marked than it is in the discrete boundaries of file
					and form, encoded information and material manifestation.</p>
				<p>Does <emph>mathesis</emph> have its triumph within the realm of the digital?
					Within digital is there a gap preserved or a gap closed as if it had never been
					open between "natural" and "computational, the serendipitious and the
					systematic, the organic/replete and the synthetic/ constructed? If
						<emph>mathesis</emph> describes the ideality of form—that is, form which is
					apparent to consciousness without any need to be manifest in material—then the
					digital condition of code storage fits that description as well. But digital
					imagery is also the curious Madrid of materially inscribed form (massively
					dependent on the apparatus of production, the computer, terminal, magnetic
					storage devices, discs, and drives) and immaterially apparent form whose two
					aspects are inseparable from each other. The coming-form which involves a
					splitting off from idea into matter is circumscribed within a single operation
					in the digital environment in a work like Latham's—but not so clearly in the
					case of Nechvatel. Each poses a different problem with respect to the
					self-identity of digital images and the dialectics essential to critical
					intervention. To frame it another way, in a paraphrase of the <persName key="Adorno, Theodor W., 1903-1969." ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/95247377" ana="webannotation:http://temp.lincsproject.ca/Tt9KF3Ambn7">Adorno</persName> quote
					above, in certain instances the how of the digital environment can be precisely
					the same as the what. The means and matter of expression of form/content,
					idea/expression, essence/accident can become indissolubly unified in the
					Mathetic condition of digital storage, thus questioning the possible basis on
					which aesthetic opposition can even be premised, let alone sustained. </p>
